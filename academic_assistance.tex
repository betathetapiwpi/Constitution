\chapter{Academic Assistance Plan}
\label{cha:academic-assistance-plan}

Once a brother has been identified as being in need of academic assistance, he
will be referred to the Kai Cabinet.
The Kai Cabinet will work with the brother to find appropriate tutoring and
other academic resources in an effort to support and help the brother.
Kai will continue to meet with the brother during the course of the term or
semester and will then review the case at the end of this period to determine
if any disciplinary action is required.
