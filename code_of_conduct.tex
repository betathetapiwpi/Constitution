\subsection{Hours to Complete}
\label{sec:hours-to-complete}

Each active brother shall complete a total of 10 hours per semester.
If a brother is inactive for a term within the semester due to off campus
IQP/MQP, co-op, medical leave or other reason determined legitimate by Kai, that
brotherâ€™s semesterly requirement is reduced by 5 hours per term.
Brothers are
also allowed to complete all of their total semester requirement independent
from Beta pending approval from the Community Service Chair.
The Community Service Chair, as outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:duties-of-the-community-service-chairman}, must approve of the
service and the brother is responsible for providing the chair with proof of
completion.

\subsection{Duties of the Community Service Chairman}
\label{sec:duties-of-the-community-service-chairman}

The Community Service Chair will be appointed at least two weeks before the end
of each semester by the Programming Committee, and is responsible for organizing
community service events throughout each term.
This brother is required to be on campus all semester and cannot be the
President, Programming Chairman, chair of another committee, or officer.
These events include, but are not limited to, the 3 events per term that span at
least 2.5 hours each as referred to in
Section~\ref{sec:community-service-event-planning}, as well as working with
brothers who cannot attend these events as outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:completion-of-hours}.
In addition to this, they are responsible for making sure each brother has
completed his required hours, and at their discretion may refer a brother to Kai
if their community service hours have not been completed.

Brothers are required to attend 2 of the 3 larger community service events
mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:community-service-event-planning}.
