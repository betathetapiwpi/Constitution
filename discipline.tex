that the interests of justice so required, the chapter may vote its decision
according to the voting procedure and may amend, modify or vacate that final

final and the decision was not the expulsion of a member from the Fraternity.

\subsection{Application of Informal Procedure}

The Informal Procedure shall be used by the Kai Cabinet when the performance of
a member is questioned.

\subsection{Informal Procedure Participants}

The Brotherhood Chairman shall chair the Informal Procedure hearing.
Any decision reached by the Kai Cabinet must be approved by a simple majority
vote of the Kai Cabinet.

        procedure established below.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Rights for the Accused}

The Accused has the right to be present at the hearing, hear the evidence
against him, ask questions of various witnesses, and present evidence in his
own behalf.
The Accused may also have a member of the Fraternity appear on his behalf to
help him in his defense.
The procedure shall provide a way for the Accused and the chapter to enter into
an agreement to settle the charge in a way agreeable to both sides.
If no compromise between the Kai Cabinet and the Accused can be agreed upon,
the Kai Cabinet shall recommend the Formal Procedure, as outlined in
Item~\ref{cha:discipline-of-members} Section~\ref{sec:trial-by-chapter}.

\section{Formal Procedure: Trial by Chapter}
\label{sec:trial-by-chapter}

The Formal Procedure for the Discipline of Members: Trial by Chapter:

\subsection{Application of Formal Procedure}

The Formal Procedure shall be used to allow the chapter as a whole to
discipline its own members.

\subsection{Restrictions on Formal Procedure}

The Formal Procedure may only be used when the Informal Procedure cannot be
used for the reasons set forth in Item~\ref{cha:discipline-of-members}
Sub-Section~\ref{sec:exceptions} of these Bylaws.

\subsection{Charges}

The chapter must prepare the charges to be filed and forward those charges to
the District Chief or Regional Chief for review in advance of presenting them
to the accused.
The chapter leadership will make arrangements for the District Chief or
Regional Chief to host a call with the executive Committee and those bringing
charges to them as soon as practical.
The District Chief or Regional Chief will counsel the members on the importance
of accuracy, validity, and thoroughness of the charges, and other procedural
issues worthy of their consideration.
The chapter will then present the charges to the accused.

\subsection{Chapter Procedure when a Brother is Accused}

Due Notice, as defined in the Appendix, must be given to the Accused.
At the time set for trial, the chapter, with a quorum present, must hear the
charge against the Accused, decide whether the charge is true and fix the
penalty upon a finding of guilt.
The Accused may waive their right to such hearing by voluntarily admitting to
the charges.

\subsection{Role of the Kai Committee:} %% Remove this colon

The Kai Committee shall organize and present the case against the Accused.

\subsection{Trial by Chapter Chair}

The parliamentarian shall chair the Trial by Chapter.
If the parliamentarian is not, as per his discretion, willing to serve as the
chair, the chapter may approve another chair by simple-majority vote.

\subsection{Admission of Charge}

The Accused shall be given an opportunity to admit or deny the charges.
If the Accused does not attend the hearing, after being given personal service
of notice, the chapter may consider the failure to appear as an admission of
the charges.
If the charge is admitted, the chapter will then, by a simple majority vote,
set the penalty.

\subsection{Order of Decision}

If the Accused denies the charge, the chapter will consider the evidence and
arguments presented by each side, and will then vote on this question: Has the
charge been proved? If a super-majority of the chapter votes in the
affirmative, the Accused stands convicted, and the chapter will then consider
and decide the penalty to be imposed by majority vote.
If not, the Accused remains not guilty.

The Accused has the following rights:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The right to due notice as defined below.
