\section{Lavaliering}

If a brother wishes to lavalier a significant other he must announce to the
chapter his intentions at a regular chapter meeting.
There will be no discussion concerning the significant other or a vote; rather
a period of one week is taken for brothers of the chapter to reflect on this
and approach the brother as they deem fit to discuss any concerns.
If after this period there are no unaddressed concerns the lavalier ceremony
will be scheduled and conducted.
Once lavaliered, the significant other will receive a lavalier representing
recognition from the chapter.

\section{Sweethearting}

If the chapter wishes to sweetheart someone of significant contribution to the
chapter, one or multiple brothers must propose the idea to the chapter at the
regular chapter meeting.
After the proposal an open discussion will commence upon the subject.
Discussion will be facilitated by the President and regulated by the
parliamentarian and a vote will be conducted according to the voting procedure.
After this vote the sweetheart ceremony will be scheduled and conducted.
Sweethearts will be able to wear the fraternity letters and receive all
national privileges reserved for sweethearts.
