\section{Transitioning to Alumni Status}

If an initiated graduate student, who has not yet been given alumni status,
wishes to remain an active brother, he may do so.
However, once the brother has accepted alumni status, he may not return to
being an active member.

An active graduate student is still required to pay dues and complete all the
duties of any active brother, such as attendance and community service, and can
be held accountable according to the Accountability Policy.

A brother who wants to stay active during graduate school must notify the
Finance Chairman before the budget is passed for the semester after they
graduate.
An active graduate student brother may not transition to being alumni until he
leaves graduate school.

\section{Alumni Attendance}

Brothers with alumni status are not permitted to go to retreat.
For other chapter events, with the exception of alumni events, the alumnus must
obtain permission to attend from the event organizer.
The event organizer may request that the alumnus contribute financially to an
event as a prerequisite for being allowed to attend.
Employees/volunteers of the Administrative Office and advisors can go to any
chapter event at the discretion of the event organizer.
